# How does touch work?
"Receptors that let the body sense touch are located in the top layers of the skin - the dermis and epidermis. The skin contains different types of receptors. Together, they allow a person to feel sensations like pressure, pain, and temperature"

# Ideas
* speaker membranes on our finger tips to simulate touch of different surfaces and textures
